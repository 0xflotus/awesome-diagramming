# awesome-diagramming
This repository is a curated collection of use-case specific diagramming tools for software engineering teams.

Diagramming tools help engineering teams in better communication. They are especially needed for remote teams. They help in onboarding new engineering folks faster, and give a good reference document for complex system design decisions. But there are so many existing tools with different use cases, that it's hard to find the best tool for job in hand. At the end, we finally end up using general purpose diagramming tools like Miro or Lucidchart for all diagramming requirements. 

So let's fix on the various kinds of use-cases for a diagramming tools:

- System design diagrams
- Sequence diagrams (for low level request cycles, especially useful in explaining microservices architecture)
- Gantt diagrams (for project planning and timeline estimation)
- Network diagrams
- 

Developers are good with code, hence tools which work on "Diagram as code" philosophy are preferred as they are less time consuming and more dynamic. System architectures are in general subject to lot of changes, and in such scenarios, dynamic tools are preferred. Open source is preferred compared to closed source due to portability.
